Welcome to Little Pythoner's documentation!
===========================================

Learn the Python programming language one question (and answer) at a
time. Understand the fundamentals first so that you have the knowledge
to make solid progress.

Currently this document is aimed at kids that attend code clubs such
as `Coder Dojo Brighton`_. Over time we hope to make it fit for anyone
that wants to learn Python.
