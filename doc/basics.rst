The Basics
==========

Learn the basics of the Python programming language.

Look at each question and see if you can answer it, then check with
the answer we've given. Do try these out in the :ref:`repl`.

What's this? :

  1

* It's a number. The number one. In Python we often use numbers and
  they are really simple to include in our programs.

Is this a number? ::

  92617384911

* Yes, a big one.

What about this, still a number? ::

  1.28374

* Yes, that's a :code:`float`, which means a floating point number, a bit bigger than 1.

If 1.2874 is a :code:`float` what type of number is :code:`123`?

* It is an :code:`int`, which means integer or whole number. 

----
  
What's this? ::

  "Hello"

* It is a :code:`string`, a sequence of characters. 

What's this? ::

  'h'

* It is also a string but with just one character. In Python you can
  use :code:`"` or :code:`'` to mark strings.

So what happens if we do this? ::

  'hello' + 'world'

* It produces the string :code:`'helloworld'`.

How would we get a space in that string?

* We could do one of the following: ::
    
  'hello' + ' ' + 'world'
  'hello ' + 'world'
  'hello' + ' world'
